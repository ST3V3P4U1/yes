        <h1>Why I Think Health is Important.</h1>
        <p>In 2015 when I was 5, I had the flu. I got it when I was with my aunt but she didnâ€™t realise so my dad found me laying in the train station shivering. My dad was horrified and rushed me to a doctor. I was fine but my dad made sure each year his family got the flu shot. In 2017, before we got the flu shot every person in our family had the flu, so we were stuck laying in our beds. But in 2020 covid came and nothing happened but in 2022 I caught viral myositis and covid and my mom broke her leg and my baby sister ripped her finger skin off the treadmill so my dad vowed to get better</p>
